# EECS 449 Jaseci Tutorial

Jaseci seems like an interesting framework for quickly developing chatbots. There is much less coding involved than what you would need to do if you were just using tensorflow by itself. The ability to generate node diagrams was also pretty useful as a visualization of the dialogue path. The concept of walkers to represent a user's traversal over the chatbot was also pretty novel. From what I can tell, the documentation is not yet 100% complete, so some of the bugs in the earlier versions of the walkthrough can be forgiven. The tutorial itself took a lot more time than I thought it would. I initially wanted to complete the assignment when it was posted, but I waited a few weeks for piazza to be populated with troubleshooting posts and the walkthrough to be fixed before attempting it agian. While the code blocks were well documented, I felt a bit lost at what the syntax for alot of the Jaseci terminal commands meant. While I don't feel 100% prepared to implement Jaseci in our team's project after completing the tutorial, I suppose I'll have to learn by doing.
